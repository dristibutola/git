#git add .                    = adds all unstaged in the repository
#git add "*.txt"              = adds all txt files in the repository
#git add *.txt                = adds all txt files in the current 
                                directory inside the repository
#git diff                     = shows unstaged differences since last commit
#git add \*.txt               = same as git add "*.txt"
#git remote add --track         master upstream git://github.com/upstreamname/projectname.git
                              =[Optional] but very useful if plan on working in project further .
                                Use the following commands to add the 'upstream'(original 
                                project location) as remote branch so that you can get their 
                                updates into your branch . 
git fetch upstream            =    to get code 
git merge upstream/master     = to merge the changes that took place in original project into my cloned repository
git branch branchname         = to make a branch
git checkout branchname       =  to enter a branch
